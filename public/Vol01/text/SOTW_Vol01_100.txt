meeting on Thursday where more than fifty were
present and the warmth of Bahai love was again
felt. Yesterday was a glorious day. In
the afternoon, the Bahais divided into three groups
and went to three different gardens outside of the
city to discuss the subject of the girls' school and
raise the funds. The young men took charge of
the matter. The meeting which I attended raised
nearly five hundred dollars-that is a great sum
for Persia just now.

Great love for all from all,
Susan I. Mood-y.

the article expresses a sympathy for the Bahai
movement that will interest Bahais.
