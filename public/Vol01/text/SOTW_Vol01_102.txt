2 BAHAI NEVVS
are the rose-gardens of the love of God and the
spirits are rejoiced through the divine Glad-tidings.
Thank ye God that ye have assembled your like-
nesses upon one page. All of you are the sons and
daughters of the Kingdom, are in perfect harmony
and united, attracted and enkindled.
Just as these bodies are assembled together, so
the hearts are attuned with the music of heaven
and the souls enraptured with the melody of Truth.
Ye are all Waves of one sea, rays of one sun, trees
of one orchard and flowers of one garden. The
power of the Kingdom hath assembled you to-
gether, and I hope that you may become assisted
in such wise as to raise the canopy of the 'oneness
of the kingdom of humanity, to unfurl the banner
of love and kindness among the sons of men, to
perfume the nostrils with the Fragrances of the
Paradise of ABHA and to illumine the hearts of the
people of the world With the splendors of the Sun
of Truth.
Upon ye be Baha

the friends and maid-servants of God. Today all
the communities of the World are engaged in fight-
ing and quarreling with each other. There is a
religious strife, a sectarian strife, racial bias, pat-
riotism, political contentions, commercial compe-
tition, industrial rivalry and a battle to defend
their honor.
In reality these strifes are continual, and there
is no cessation or interruption thereto. Now con-
sider ye With what power and strength, love and
devotion, union and harmony, happiness and joy
