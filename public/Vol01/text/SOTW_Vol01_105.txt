BAHAINEVVS 5
beneficial, it would have been brought into the
world by the divine creation and not by the effort
of man. Whatever is beneficial for man exists in
creation. Now, it has been proved and is estab-
lished medically and scientifically that liquors are
harmful.
Therefore the meaning of that which is writ-
ten in the Tablets: have chosen for thee what-
soever is in the heaven and earth," signifies those
things which are according to the divine creation
and not the things which are harmful. For in-
stance, poison is one of the things: now, can we
say that poisons are to be used habitually because
God has created them for man? However, spiritu-
ous liquors, if prescribed by ta physician for the
patient and their use is necessary, then they may
be used as directed.
In brief, I hope that thou mayest find eternal
bliss and receive inexhaustible joy and happiness.
The after effect of drinking is depression, but the
wine of the Love of God bestows exaltation of the
spirit.
Upon thee be Baha

Thy letter was received. The science of num-
bers is one of the common sciences, but the aim
of Abdul-Baha is, that the Heavenly Knowledge
