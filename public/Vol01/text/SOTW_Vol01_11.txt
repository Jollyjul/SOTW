needed that this Service may extend unto all. In a
word: It is your Service and needs your assistance.
It is our hope that the Bahai News may appear
every 19 days, but if the subscriptions received do
not warrant the expense of so doing by covering
the cost of printing and postage, it will appear less
frequently during the year, according to the means
at hand.
We trust the Bahai News will be a messenger of
peace, in accord with the spirit of the Cause it
hopes to serve. To this end its editors respectfully
request that contributors of news endeavor to follow
the Biblical injunction "to be wise as serpents and
harmless as doves."
The next issue of the Bahai" News will be sent
out in envelopes bearing only this inscription: "If
not delivered, return to P. O. Box 283, Chicago, Ill.,
U. S. Any particular mailing instructions to
be pursued in special cases should be clearly stated
and will be followed faithfully. Subscribers will
please read general information outlined in editorial
heading, noting that all copies to the Orient will be
mailed as first-class matter.

ye friends and the mlaid-servants of the erciful.'
If it is your intention to have the general Gon-
vention in Chicago on the day of Naurooz, so that
delegates might be sent there from everywhere to
deliberate and discuss matters pertaining to the
Mashrak~el-Azkar, to proclaim the oneness of the
kingdom of humanity, to explain the Divine Teach-
ings and to elucidate and expound the Exhortations
of the Blessed Perfection,--it is better to open this
Convention during the Feast of Rizwan; for the
Feast of Rizwan is greater and more important
and the temperature at that time mild and balmy.
