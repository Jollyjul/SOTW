CHICAGO.
The Unity Feast of June 5th, held at the resi-
dence of Mrs. E. F. Davies, 5847 LaSa11e St., was
an occasion of spiritual uplifting to the many who
attended.
Mrs. Corinne True is now at her summer home
in Fruitport, Mich., which is an active Bahai cen-
ter. Mrs. Louise R. Waite is spending a couple of
weeks with her.
Mrs. Eva Webster Russell and Miss Beatrice
Davies expect to leave Chicago about July 1st for
an eastern trip and summer outing. They will
visit the Washington, D. and Baltimore Assem-
blies, then go to Norfolk, Va., and from there to
New York City. Miss Davies will return to Chi-
cago from New York and Mrs. Russell will go to
Providence, R. I., returning home some time in

LONDON, ENGLAND.
The BAHAI comes to us with refreshing"tid-
ings of progress in all lands.
Our hearts have been made glad with the su-
premest joy in hearing the verbal messages brought
us by Miss Buckton and Miss Schepel who have
spent a few weeks at Acca. Miss Buckton is a
strong club woman here and her return has been
the means of spreading the "Glad-tidings" among
many who otherwise would have waited long for
this Message.
At a recent meeting Mons. Dreyfus, of Paris,
gave us an inspiring talk. He was en route for
America. This address was listened to with much
interest by a good number of believers who gather
each Friday evening at 10 Chemiston Gardens, Ken-
sington.
