TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA TO THE
BELIEVERS OF GOD IN PERSIA.
Upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!
HE IS eon!
0 God! God! Verily, verily the reality of
Thy Oneness is sanctified above ascent or descent,
and the Sun of Thy Singleness is holy above ap-
pearance or disappearance. Thou hast been in the
mystery of Thine Identity and the eternality of
Thine Existence; moving in the exaltation of Thy
Sanctity and the loftiness of Thy Purity. The
souls who penetrate through the facts of life can-
not know Thee, and the minds which are imbued
with the subtleties of the universe do not appre-
hend Thee. Far from the spiders of imagination
to weave the Web of their Weak thoughts in the
imperial palaces of Thy Knowledge, and far from
the birds of understanding to attempt soaring
with their broken wings toward the golden apex
of Thine Explanation! Verily, all the wings of
effort are broken and Will. not reach the glorious
heaven of Thy Singleness. The intellects are be-
wildered and if they cannot comprehend one verse
of the verses of Thine Omnipotence, how then can
they perceive Thy Reality which surrounds all
things and is not surrounded! Thy Holy and
Sanctified Identity is beyond the knowledge of the
wisest and mightiest in the World of emanation!
0 Lord! Lord! Deliver the souls from the
superstitions, that they may not imagine any dis-
appearance for Thy Lights, any setting for Thy
Luminary, any descent for Thy Reality, and any
ascent for Thy Identity. For verily Thou art
above all these qualifications and beyond all these
attributes. Thou hast been and forever shalt be
in Thine lnaccessible Station and Thine Unattain-
able Position. The road is barred and the path
is closed, Thy Proof is Thy Verses and Thy
Path is Thy Dominion.
