and commendation on behalf of all, saying that--
Praise be to the friends in all parts of
Persia are firm in the Covenant, have taken hold
of the Testament of His Highness the Merciful:
their minds are full of acclamations, their faces
illumined, their hearts aspiring and their spirits
soaring toward the Realm of Truth, their souls
full of glad-tidings and their consciences in infinite
happiness, Day and night they are engaged in
spreading the fragrances, and morning and eve-
ning they deliver the Word of God. They are the
Signs of Oneness and the Tokens of the Bounties
of the Glorious Lord. They are the bright lamps
and incontrovertible proofs. They are the horizons
of knowledge and the hosts of the Supreme Con-
course. In reality he has given the greatest praise
and glorification. On account of this news great
happiness was produced in the hearts of the be-
lievers, and all are expressing their most wonder-
ful glad-tidings.
I beg of God, that day by day this Fire>> may
consume the world, and this Flame enkindle the
earth; this Favor become all-surrounding and
this Path straight. Cast ye into oblivion all signs
of attachment and impurity so that all the regions
may become sanctified and purified and all the
dawning-places shining and illumined. Then the
Paradise of ABI-IA will be established in the East
and in the West, the glorious outpouring of the
Majestic Lord, become universal, the principles
of the Cause produce results and the structure of
the Revelation of Truth reach to the Mansions of
the Supreme Heights.
Upon ye be Glory!
