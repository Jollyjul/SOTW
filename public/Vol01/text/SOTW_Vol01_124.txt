The following letter from Monsieur Hippolyte
Dreyfus, of Paris, now traveling in America, will
be of interest to all:
To the Editors of the BAI-IAI NEws.
Dear Friends: I trust I will be allowed to use the
publicity of the BAHAI NEws for sending to all the
Assemblies of America, which I am not able to visit
in this too short trip, the love and the greetings of
our friends in Paris; and also for conveying to all a
little suggestion which the reading of the 4th issue of
your publication, giving the account of the Convention
in Chicago, and only just received--from Paris, has
led me to deem advisable.
I really think that we should make a point never
