LOS ANGELES.
Secretary of Assembly, F. B. Beckett, 429 Citizens
National Bank Bldg.
Mrs. Replogle, of Bakersfield, formerly of Bal-
timore, has moved to Los Angeles.
Miss Ella Bailey, of Berkeley, visited the friends
here for two days and is now spending the summer
at Banning, California.
Tropico is a beautiful suburb of Los Angeles,
about nine miles away, and so many of the
friends live there that the Unity Feasts are now
regularly held in Tropico. There was a happy
gathering at "El Azkar," the home of Mr. and
Mrs. A. J. Frankland, June 24th. Mr. and Mrs.
VVinterburn, Mr. and Mrs. Cline, Mr. and Mrs.
Beckett, Mrs. Stoddard, Mrs. Carvel, Miss Tesky,
Mrs. Roper, all of Tropico, were there and also
two visit-ors, one from near San Diego and another
from Nevada. These meetings are attended by
about fifteen believers and the number is steadily
growing.
A beautiful work is being done through the
efforts of the friends in Friday afternoon meetings,
where the study of the Ighan is being pursued in
a systematic manner under the wise guidance of
Mrs. Winterburn_ This work is attracting some
earnest students whose interest is growing. Regu-
lar group meetings are held weekly at Miss Ham-
mond's home in Pasadena and at Mrs. Phi11ip's
home in Los Angeles. The open meetings on
Sundays in Blanchard Library Hall are attended
by about forty people and are a means of present-
ing the glad-tidings to strangers who go to a hall
rather than to a home, to learn What is going on.
It is hoped that many of them shall find their
heart's desire in the wonderful Words of Truth
that are offered to them in the Bahai Revelation.
Thahbet.
