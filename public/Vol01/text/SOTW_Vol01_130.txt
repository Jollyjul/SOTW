Word has come from D-r. Moody that the
Teheran Board of Consultation has supplicated
Abdul-Baha that Miss Lillian Kappes might be
permitted to come to that city to teach in the
Girls' Bahai School, and that Dr. Moody had
personally supplicated that Miss Elizabeth H.
Stewart might be permitted to come to Teheran
as professional nurse to assist the doctor in her
medical work. If these supplications are accepted,
the hope of the Persian friends is that they can
join Mr. Sydney Sprague in Haifa and return with
him to Teheran. Isabella D. Brittingham.
