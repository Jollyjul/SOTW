11 o'clock, in Beckton Hall, 200 Huntington avenue.
Miss Fannie Knobloch, of the Washington, D. C.,
Assembly, spoke at the meeting of February 27th,
and gave an account of her visit to Abdul-Baha.
There were 32 at the meeting and all came nearer
to Acca and to Abdul-Baha through the spiritual
words of this maid-servant of God. In the evening
a Feast was held in Salem at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. John S. Crowley about fifteen miles from Bos-
ton. From 30 to 35 were present, many being
friends who had heard the Message. Miss Knoblock
told us of the Feast in Acca at which she was present
with Mrs. Finch and Miss Alma Knobloch. The
spirit and power oi Abdul-Baha were with us, bind-
ing our hearts to His heart.
Feasts were held at the homes of the believers
each night from February 26 to March 2, inclusive.
Miss Marie du Bedat, of New York, is in Boston
for a few weeks and is in attendance at the meet-
mgs.
