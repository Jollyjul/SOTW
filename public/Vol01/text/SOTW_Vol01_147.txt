BAHAINEVVS 15
I know that Abdul-Baha is still anxious to have an
Occidental-Oriental publication to further the holy
work. I feel that the BAHAI NEWS is a most impor-
tant step toward this other Work, and at the same
time is accomplishing a long needed Work among the
English speaking assemblies. 
Faithfully yours in His Cause,
CHARLES REMEY.
With this issue of the BAH-AI NEWS, through
the inauguration of a section in Persian, we be-
lieve a stronger bond
of Unity Will be es-  
tablished between the 
East and the West,   *1  
for it is evident that 
so long as this pub-
lication appeared
only in English We
could not fully serve
the Cause in the
East, especially Per-
"dawning-
place" of the Univer-
sal Light of this
Great Day.
This 
der the title, "Occi-
dental Messenger,"
and the able guid-
ance of Mirza Ahmad
0 a en-
deavor to unfold
thoughts
and methods for our
Oriental brothers
and sisters. In this
initial section of six
pages he treats upon
the power of the
press and the need of
a literary organ be-
tween the East and MIRZA 
the -'Vest to spread Editor of BAHAI NEWS
Tablets and news of the Cause; he outlines nine
articles of policy, concluding with an appeal for
co-operation in this endea to serve humanity
and make the publication a success.
