16 BAHAI NEVVS
HONOLULU.
Mr. Charles Mason Remey and Mr. Howard O.
Struven, who are taking a trip around the World,
found a very Warm Welcome awaiting them when
they reached Honolulu -and spent three Weeks with
the Bahai friends there. On the day of their arrival
forty-one persons gathered at the home of one of

the Revelation of and during the three
Weeks they gave the Message in eight homes, in ad-

Where about eighty persons were present and that
was followed by a meeting at the Art League to those
interested. "Te quote from a letter Written by one
of our Bahai sisters in Honolulu: "Mr. Remey and
Mr. Struven Were entertained, during their visit, in
the best of our homes, and many Words of praise
of them were spoken. The Whole atmosphere seemed
to breathe peace and joy and love. God has truly
been with them and We have been greatly blessed."
KENOSI-IA.
The Kenosha Assembly has its own hall and all
functions of the Assembly are carried on in this
central pl-ace of meeting.
A Sunday school for children is held preceding the
regular Weekly service of the Assembly. On Tuesday
evening the Board of Council meets to act upon all
matters brought before that body; and on Thursday
evening a class is held for the study of the Book
of Ighan.
The industrial school for girls, which meets on
Saturday afternoon, has now 125 enrolled, taxing
the capacity of the hall. This school has been in
operation three years and is the most successful of
its kind in Kenosha.
We are glad to hear from the friends, and com-
munications sent to the secretary, Mr. Fountain
Nichols, 314 Valentine street, will be brought to
the attention of all. Bernard M. Jacobson.
