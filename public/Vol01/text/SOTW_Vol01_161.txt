BAHAI NEWS 5
INTERVIEW WITH ABDUL-BAHA.
Extract from a letter written by a Mrs. (Fro-ckett,
May, I910, to Miss Frances Johnson, Pearl City,
Hawaii:
I must tell you a little about Palestine and about
one experience in particular. A visit to- Palestine
does certainly make the Bible seem like a new
book and brings home to one's heart the reality of
Christ's life and teachings.
I felt this particularly at Nazareth, the home of
His boyhood, and at the Sea of Galilee, which is
so associated with His ministry. We had a lovely
early morning row on the peaceful lake, and the
memories of Christ that came to us seemed to
make His presence very real.
Now, I know you will be eager to hear of my in-
terview with the one in Palestine whose teachings
mean so much to you, the Prophet, or Abbas Ef-
fendi,* as he is generally called.
I found that he is not now kept a prisoner at
Acca, but since the -order of constitutional govern-
ment in Turkey he is free to live in his home at
Haifa (near by) and go and come as he will.
I planned my trip so that I could stop and see
him, for I remember when you gave me some of
the literature to read you saidzt "If you go to
Egypt, Palestine is not far away and you will
surely want to see him." So I planned for the in-
terview with him when the others of the party
went to Acca for a drive". (Perhaps youknow that
Haifa is a pretty little town right at the foot of
M1. Carmel.)
Well, I sent word to him of my wish to see him
and he replied that he would see me in -the after-
noon, as his time was taken up that morning in
seeing some people from India. So I went to his
house at the time appointed and was shown into
the presence of an old man, clothed in the flowing
robe of a Persian, with white hair and a long white
beard, with eyes that seemed to look me through
and yet were most friendly, too. It was the
Prophet! He received me most graciously, and his
interpreter, a young Syrian, a student at the Amer-
ican Missionary College at Beyrout.
