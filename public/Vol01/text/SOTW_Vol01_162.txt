6 BAHAI 
I told him first about the little circle of his
friends in far off who meet to-
gether to discuss his teachings--and I told him of
your love and loyalty. He seemed very happy at
this and his face lighted up as he asked for the
names of those who knew and loved him. 
He sent you all his love and blessing and said he
would pray for each one of you, and he added:
"Tell them that they have a great mission--to make
the blind eyes see, to make the deaf ears hear and
to shed the light of knowledge where the darkness
of ignorance prevails." That was his message to
you. He talked with me for some time, first tell-
ing me of his country, Persia, of his life and then
of his teachings.
As he talked with me I felt my heart soften un-
der the infiuence of his goodness and kindness,
and the tears came to my eyes. He asked me about
myself, if I were well and if I were happy. I re-
plied to the latter question: have had many
sorrows." "Forget them!" he answered. "When
your heart is filled with the love of God there will
be no room for sorrow. There will only be love
and happiness." I cannot tell you the sweet sym-
pathy of his voice as he said these beautiful a11d
comforting words.
Then he had the attendant bring in teadrank together,
wishing each other health and happiness, and then
he told me that he hoped he should take tea with
me in the Kingdom of Heaven!
When I praised the tea he said it was real Per-
sian tea and presented me with a package to take
away with me. (I wish I could send you some of
it. I am afraid it would lose its strength though
before it reached you.)
When I finally said good-by he put his hand on
my head and blessed me and wished that I might
be a blessing. I went away feeling soft-
ened, uplifted and blessed. I am so glad you told
me of him and urged me to see him. He wrote his
name in my book for me and told me always to
remember it.
I tell you all these little incidents as I know
they will interest you.
