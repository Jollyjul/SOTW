THE MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR.
A recent pilgrim to Acca wrote to the Financial
Secretary that when she was in Haifa last winter
she asked Abdul-Baha if it was not of great impor-
tance to help in the sending of spiritual people to
Syria to be taught by him, and he replied: "It is
now of utmost importance for the Mashrak-e1-
Azkar to be built." Corinne True.

BF-I-IEVER5 OF SPOKANE. WASH., HOLDING A UNITY FEAST
IN A sununn or THEIR CITY.
The Unity Feast is regularly observed, being
served at the homes of the different believers.
Your correspondent served the Feast falling on
June 5th; it was an out-of-door meeting, with
twenty in attendance. The day was perfect, and
as we wended our way up the hillside and spread
the feast beneath the pine trees in a pleasant spot
overlooking the valley, a sweet spirit of harmony
and unity prevailed. After the Feast photographs
were taken, copies of which will be forwarded to
the friends in Persia. On June 24th the Feast was
held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Killius; it was
well attended and a time of spiritual uplift.
