BAHAI 17
"early days" in Chicago. Through all change and
stress their faith has never been shaken, their love
never waned. There is a strength, a certainty, an
authority, an assurance in the Bahai Vv'ord, which

teachings to such a degree that, when once really
taste-cl, there is no appetite for any other thing.
VVeel<ly group meetings are held in Los Angeles,
Pasadena and Tropico, at the homes, respectively, of
Mrs. Phillips, Miss Hammond, and Mr. and Mrs.
i/Vinterburn. A general public meeting is held once
a month in a hall in the city, to which the friends
gather from their several localities Within a radius
of twenty miles. L-os Angeles is in the same latitude
as Acca, and We turn our hearts and faces directly
to the East, to the Center of the Covenant, the
shining Orb of guidance. Thus East and West are
united in love and praise, communion and service.
