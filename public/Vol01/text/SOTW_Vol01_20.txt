The Mysterious Forces
of Civilization
A new book of Bahai teaching printed in
London, England, copies of which may now be
had of Bahai Publishing Society, Chicago.
T/ze puelis/zers' advertisement of the iiaok is as
follows:
This very remarkable book was Written some
thirty years ago by Abdul-Baha, the present
revered Bahai leader, and there is little doubt
that it was no insignificant factor in preparing
his compatriots for the present constitutional
regime.
It contains an exposition of his philosophy,
indispensable to every serious student of the
Bahai movement.
The translation is the Work of Mr. Johanna
Dawud, Who has endeavored to convey to the
reader, not only the deep spiritual significance
of the master's teaching, but to retain, as near-
ly as the diflerence of idiom allows, the wealth
of Oriental imagery and metaphor which forms
so striking a feature of the original.
