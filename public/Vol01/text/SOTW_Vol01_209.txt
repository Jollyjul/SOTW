Mount Carmel, August 29, 1910.
Dear Sister in the Holy Cause:--I have a very big
piece of news to tell you. Abdul-Baha has left this
Holy Spot for the first time in forty-two years, and
has gone to Egypt. Think of the vast significance
and importance of this step! By it many prophecies
of the sacred Scriptures are fulfilled. The Light and
Life of Acca has departed and we feel as though We
were now left in obscurity while Egypt is. illumined,
and that ancient country which has seen the prophets
oseph. and Moses and even .the infant Christ is now
to see the Consummation of all the prophets. Will
it appreciate and realize this Bounty? Everyone was
astounded to hear of Abdul-Baha's departure, for no
one knew until the very last minute that he had any
idea of leaving. The afternoon of the day he left, he
came to Mir-zar Assad Ullah's home to see us and sat
With, us awhile beside a new Well that has just been
finished and said that he had come to taste the water.
We did not realize that it was a good-bye visit. Then
he took a carriage and Went up the hill to the Holy
Tomb (of the Bab). That night, as usual, the be-
lievers gathered before the house of Abdul~Baha to
receive that blessing, which every day is ours, of" be-
ingin his presence, but we Waited in vain, for one of
the sons-in-law came and told bus that Abdul-Baha
had taken the Khedivial steamer for Port Said. We
could hardly believe it was true, so great was this
news. Think how happy we must be that after forty-
two years in this cage, the Divine Bird has spread
His wings and in perfect freedom flown away.

has been received from Port Said
that Abdul-Baha has sailed from that port on a
steamer for an unknown destination.
