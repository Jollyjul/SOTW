THE OUTLOOK IN JAPAN.
Extract from a letter written by Mr. C'harl6~S'
Mason Remey, dated on board N. L. S. S. Biilow,
between Shanghai and Singapore, Jan. 14, 1910, to
the House of Spirituality, Chicago, Ill.:
In Japan the spiritual field of Work is ready for
the laborers. The Japanese need religion and,
unlike most people, they realize this need and are
searching. In Japan there is no 
whatever. Even the Buddhist priests hail with
joy the coming of another Messenger of Peace.
They are all awaiting the coming of the Message.
The Japanese, like the Bahais, accept the Christ

churches. The people who can be reached in Japan
are not uneducated, but the first men of the coun-
try. With us in the West it is the people of small
importance in the world's who are seeking
Truth, whereas in Japan the nobility and the chief
thinkers of the country are considering the spirit-
ual question, for it has been clearly proved in Japan
that man cannot live by ethics alone. Thousands
of Bahai teachers are needed in Japan! Only
yesterday I was reading the life -of Saint Francois
Xavier, the first Christian missionary to Japan,
and of his trials an.d hardships and of the great
fruits of his Work, and With all my soul I prayed
that God would now raise up Bahais to go to that
same country and proclaim the Kingdom estab-
lished! Cannot you, as a body, take some action
in this matter and make the Way for several Ba~
hais to go to the field of work in Japan? A
willing American would have no difiiculty in mak-
ing a good living in China or Japan, and I trust
that soon some of our Bahais may come out as
teachers. Whoever comes in this Cause must be
well prepared so far as teaching is concerned;
