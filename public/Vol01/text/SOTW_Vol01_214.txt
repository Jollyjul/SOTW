6. BAHAI NEYVS
The treasurer reports money in bank October 1-st,
$3,108.14; interest due in December, ?375.00, and a
note of $5,150.00 to be met January 1, 1911. Thus, in.
two months at least $2,500 more will be needed.
Abdul-Baha said to some Chicago pilgrims: "The
most important thing now in America is the build-
ing of the Mashrak-el-Azrkar. You and your friends
must endeavor in this matter. This building will be
the cause of the confirmation of the believers. It has
a great effect because it is the beginning of the foun-
dation. After centuries it is not so important as it is
now, but now it is very important. At first they build
the Temple and worship in it and grow. In past
times they could not build it so outwardly. This
bm'Zd?z'ng w'ill be the cause of Unity and prosperity of
the Cause."
asked by a pilgrim last year if he would
come to America, Abdul-Baha. replied: "If they build
the Again, when entirely alone
with him,' this pilgrim asked, you come to
America His face grew very serious and a great
majesty came upon it. After a second or two he con-
tinued: "If the ground. in America .is well prepared
so that much work can be done for the Cause." The
pilgrim then said to him, the responsibility rested
upon the believers, and he replied: "The building of
the will prepare that ground."
The friends will read elsewhere in this issue "a
description of Abdul-Baha's sudden departure for
Egypt. Let America take warning from this sudden
departure and exert her utmost energy lest Abdul-
Baha come upon us suddenly and "find us sleeping."
As one soul in many bodies let the believers of
America work and pray till the Mashrak-el-Azkar is
accomplished. All contributions will be received and
receipted for by the financial secretary, Mrs. Corinne
