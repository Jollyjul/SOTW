BAHAI NEWS 11
grandfather of Messrs. Edward and Howard Struven, at his late
residence, Catonsvilleenjoyed very
much, even with his feeble and failing sight, the reading of
such Bahai literature in German as could be secured.
The Baltimore Assembly has changed the Sunday Bible class
from afternoons to evenings, and plans an alternation of lenders.
The work in Suruerduck, Va., progresses, and the meeting on
the fourth Sunday of each month has been adopted permanently.
At the last meeting, the school house was too small to accommo-
date those who came, some driving several miles to hear the
Glad-tidings. Any of the friends who undertake teaching in the
smaller and isolated communities will find a gratifying number
of thoughtful, earnest souls ready to listen.
