TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
To the Believers in Systan, Persia.
Upon tl1em be tl1e Glory of God the Most Glorious.
HE IS eon!
ye believers of Goal amd freinds of Abdul-Baha!
If ye knew how the heart of Abdul-Baha is soaring
at this moment at your mentioning and the spirit
is rejoicing at your name, undoubtedly you would
not contain yourselves in this physical temple,
neither would you have heeded any persecution or
sufi"ering.
Today the world of existence is moved through
the Call of the Covenant, and the disjoin-ed members
of this earth have fo.und mutual communication.
Consider ye that the confusion produced thereby can-
not be cleared and the forces cannot be brought to-
g-ether save through the Power of the Testament,
and the darkness of the East and the West can only
be dispelled through the Sun of the Covenant. The
Divine Covenant is like unto the spiritual Spring-
time, which encircles all creation.
Now the greatest tes-t for a tree is to have the
latent possibility of fruition, and with the appearance
of the spring they put forth leaves, branch-es and
blossoms, but if a tree is barren at this season it
will remain deprived and fruitless. Likewise, those
souls who have been firm in the Covenant of God.
are detached from all else save God, and are at-
tracted to the fragrances of God, their faces will
shine like unto the luminous moon, with the Light
of Assurance. But the jealous bats, the people of in-
justice and pride, flew away from the Light of the
Covenant and shrank out of sight into the dark dun-
geon of hesitation and fear. They have left the
lamp of the Testament and are running in the Sahara
of discord and are seeking the "gloom of Worldliness.
They turned away from the Pure Spring of Life and
attached themselves to the stagnant pools of super-
stition. They left behind the Paradise of ABHA and
were contented with this nether World.
