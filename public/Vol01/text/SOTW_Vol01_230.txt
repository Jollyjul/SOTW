6 BAHAI 
\\'l1iC'l1 We will b-e able to accomplish maximum re-
from the means at- hand.
Xothing pleases Abdul-Baha more than when the
friends, through consultation and unity, inaugurate
and carry on Works of service. It is our privilege
to ask him to guide and confirm us in carrying on
these works. This he stands ever ready to do.
Faithfully yours in His service,
CHARLES Mason REMEY.
