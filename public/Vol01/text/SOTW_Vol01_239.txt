BAHAI NEVVS 15
To the Editors of the BAHAI NEWS:
The believers Wish me to extend hearty thanks for the
highly appreciated BAHAI NEws, which is- always translated
into the German, bringing welcome breezes from the Kingdom
of ABHA. We are greatly indebted to you for the benefits
received. hearing thereby of the great advancement and prog-
ress made in the Cause throughout the world.
Mr. Mountfort Mills, of the New York Assembly, spoke to us
at a social Bahai gathering held Sunday evening, Sept. llth,
giving interesting and very helpful notes takes at Acca. The
spiritual fragrances from the powerful 'Words of Abdul-Baha
were highly instructive and deeply felt by all. Recognizing the
importance of co-working in this Most Great Cause. whereby
the bonds of unity are strengthened, his visit will ever be
remembered. 
We are now sending Bahai literature to different cities and
towns in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. We pray that
God may bless the seeds that have been sown. A. S. K.
