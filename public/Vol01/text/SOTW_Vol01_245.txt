TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
To the Members of the Spiritual Assembly of
Esphahan, Persia.
Upon them be the Glory of God the Most Glorious!
HE Is eon!
ye illuminecl Friends of Abdul-Baha!
Praise be to God, that you have organized and
established a new assembly in the land of Esphahan
and with the utmost devotion its members are arising
to serve the Blessed Perfection I
was pleased to know, also, that you have organized
a committee for correspondence with all parts of the
world, and another committee to teach the Truth to
the youths. VVonderful confirmation and complete
assistance is destined for all the members of these
various committees. This move is identical with
blessing and this glorious intention is accepted in
the Threshold of Oneness. It is my hope that you
may perform these services in a befitting manner;
that you may become the dawning-places of the
Bounties of the Infinite; centers of merciful feelings
and the manifestors of the rays of the Everlasting
Glory.
I trust that you may make the land of Esphahan
a salubrious fountain, so that the cool water of
knowledge and the flowing river "of assurance may
make that region the envy of the green garden of
Paradise. That city was illumined. with the pres-
ence of His Highness, the Bab, after The left Shiraz;
the Word of God was promulgated; m-any blessed
souls became believers; a number of them hastened
toward the arena of his highness, the
leader of the righteous ones, the "King of the Mar-
tyrs," and the master of the friends, the "Beloved
of gave up their lives at the altar of
love. His Highness, Ashraf, and many other 
drank the cup of trials and sacrificed their lives
with the utmost severance. Therefore, it is the hope
of Abdul-Baha that that region may become the
Green Garden and that city the delectable Paradise.
Upon ye be the Glory of God
