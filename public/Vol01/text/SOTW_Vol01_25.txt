THE MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR.
Since last issue the friends _from many parts
have remembered the Mashrak-el-Azkar. One gift
of special importance is a contribution from the
friends of Paris, France, because it comes to us
from them at a time when they have passed through
dire great flood.
The contribution from the Honolulu Assembly
comes with such a sparkle that we must quote
from Mrs. Coombs' letter, as their secretary: "Hop-
ing that all offerings are sent with as much love
and as willing hearts as ours."
The financial secretary is most happy to report
that over sixty towns or cities of America are con-
tributing to the great Mashrak-el-Azkar work.
The following countries have sent contributions
since last Convention: Canada, Mexico, England,
France, Germany, Turkey in Europe, Russia, Per-
sia, India, Syria and Egypt.
Abdul-Baha said to Mr. Mountfort Mills of New
York City, that he was most pleased and satisfied
with last year's Convention and assured us that
the future would see many more, constantly in-
creasing in attendance and bringing together repre-
sentatives from all parts of the world. He said
that these gatherings would be to the spiritual
body of the world what the inrush of the spirit is
to the physical body of man, quickening it to its
utmost parts and infusing a new light and power.
