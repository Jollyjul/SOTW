BAHAI NEWS 7
THE MASHRAK--EL-AZKAR IN AMERICA.
"When the Mashrak-el-Azkar was erected in Ishkabad, its in-
fluence Was felt in all the Oriental countries. Whosoever heard
of it, commenced an investigation of the Cause. Now, the Mash-
rak-el-Azkar of Ishkabad, like an evident banner, waves in the
World. And if in Chicago the Mashrak-e1-Azkar is established,
even as in Ishkabad, then you will see what the recognition
of the Cause will do; particularly the arrangement of the
Mashrak-el-Azkar is such that it will exert the greatest efiect
upon the civilized World, for it has many accessories. Among
them are the following: A school for orphans; a college for
higher scientific education (or higher knowledge) a hospital; a
home for cripples; a hospice. When the Mashrak-el-Azkar, with
its accessories, be established in the world, aside from its re-
ligious or spiritual influence, it will have a tremendous efiect
upon civilization. Aside from the religionists who will feel its
influence, materialists will not be exempt therefrom. Moreover,
it contains Divine wisdoms, spiritual effects upon the intellects
and thoughts. Subsequent to its erection these will become evi-
dent. ABBAS.
Above the head of America today is suspended a
golden crown Whose jewels will scintillate through-
out centuries and cycles. Shall she adorn her head
with this priceless diadem? The old adage, "no
cross, no crown," is true regarding this glorious
crown. Can We Work hard enough and sacrifice deep
enough and look far into the future for results"?
This Mashrak-el-Azkar Will, perhaps, be the only one
built in America during the remaining years of
Abdul-Baha's mission and it behooves us to
bring this project to a po-int of completion that its
corner stone may be laid in the event of his coming
to America next spring. If We do not awake to this
golden opportunity, future generations will point
to us and say: "Why did the early Bahais of
America sleep so long and let this, one of the most
glorious privileges of the ages, slip by unheeded 
Stop and meditate, friends, upon the necessary part
a Mashrak-el-Azkar, dedicated by his holy presence,
Will play in the future history and development of
the World. VVill it not becomea visiting point for
all na.tions and people throughout centuries and
cycles? The inflow thus produced Will return an
outflow of vitalizing spiritual influence and its acces-
sories will shed the light of the highest sciences,
arts and crafts and the most magnanimous Works of
charity and hospitality.
