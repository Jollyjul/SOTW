To the Believers of God in Ghale Darre,
Persia.
Upon them be the Glory of God the Most Glorious!

ye servaln-ts of the Blessed Perfecfio-n."
In the Day of the Manifestation, you have caught
the lights from the Manifestor on the Mount of
Sinai and beheld the splendor of the Ray of Truth.
Ye are the children of the Period of 
and have become the appearance of the Effulgence
of Mercifulness in the Day wherein the rays of the
Divine Sun radiate upon all things. Tear down the.
old garment and clad your sanctified temples with
the new robe! Ye have passed from the salty water
of ignorance and have drunk the salubrious salsabil
of knowledge. Ye have closed your eyes to the Wine
of heedlessness and became intoxicated with the
choice sealed wine of intelligence! Ye have taken
the cup of prosperity from the cupbearer of the
Covenant and with infinite rejoicing, happiness and
beatitude celebrated the Feast of beholding the rays
of the Orb of regions!
Now is the time that we may sacrifice, for the sake
of the Love of that Beloved, our spirit, our soul, our
heart, our mind, our property, our life and our all;
and to wish for nothing but His good--pleasure,_
search for nothing but His Path, and desire nothing
but His Service!
Upon ye be Glory!
