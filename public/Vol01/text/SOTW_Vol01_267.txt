IN AMERICA.
"The beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful
intend to found a Mashrak-el-Azkar in Chicago. They have sent
to us numerous plans that one may be accepted and the edifice
be built accordingly. Now the funds must be accumulated, the
land entirely paid for and the necessary preparations for build-
ing made and then the accessory matters considered. Therefore,
make ye an eflfort and show ye zeal that the price of the land
be fully discharged and the means for the edifice 
ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
On Tuesday, November 29th, a very interesting
event for the Temple site took place. The new
drainage canal skirting the entire western boundary
of the Mashrak-el-Azkar land was formally opened
and the water from Lake Michigan turned into the
channel. The public schools in the vicinity were
dismissed for the occasion and fully five hundred
children were grouped on the bank of the canal.
As the water began to flow through the opening,
some of the Bahais stood on thebank and repeated
the Greatest Name.
The water on its onward flow through the busy
city must first lave the Mashrak-el-Azkar grounds,
and we pray that a blessing may rest upon these
waters, and a healing, purifying effect be carried
through them to wash away the impurities of the
great city. As this land lies at the intake of this
pure stream of water to be used for cleansing drain-
age purposes, is it not symbolic of the Water of Life,
contained in the Word of God, flowing down from the
spiritual edifice, the Mashrak-el-Azkar, to cleanse the
hearts of its inhabitants from impurities and cause to
spring up in them divine attributes and character-
istics'? Thus a new spiritual city will replace the
present mart of intensest commercialism.

CONVERSATIONAL PERSIAN TAUGHT BY
CORRESPONDENCE.
The Bah-a-i Correspond-ence School teaches Persian by simple
lessons and phonographic records. Each pupil receives all
necessary individual help and attention through a system of
written lessons and criticisms. No Persian written characters
are used; the English letters only are employed and pronuncia-
tions expressed in English characters. Many are taking advan-
tage of this system, both in Europe and in America.
