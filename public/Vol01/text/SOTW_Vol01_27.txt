BAHAI NEWS 7
LOS ANGELES.
An informal organization has been effected of
the Bahai Assembly of Los Angeles, including be-
lievers in the city of Los Angeles, Tropico, Glen-
dale, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Ocean Park and
Pasadena. The Executive Board is comprised of
five members: Mr. Charles F. Haney, Mr. Thornton
Chase, Mrs. Henrietta Clark Wagner, Mrs. Nellie
Phillips and Mrs. Rosa V. the
Writer, Mr. F. B. Beckett, as Secretary. In the
future, to assure prompt receipt, all communica-
tions to this Assembly, as Well as all matter for
distribution among the believers in this part of the
country, should be addressed to the Secretary,
429 Citizens National Bank Building, Los Angeles,
California.
The Los Angeles Bahai Assembly was organized
with thirty believers, who signified their belief in
writing. There are as many more who are in fact
believers in the Revelation of but who
do not wish yet to connect themselves definitely
with any organization, no matter 110W informal it
may be, beside a large number of people who seem
deeply interested. Meetings are held on Thursday
afternoons in Pasadena, Tuesday afternoons and
Friday evenings in the city of Los Angeles, and
Friday afternoons and Sunday evenings in Tropico;
also, once a month, on Sunday afternoon, a meet-
ing is held in a down-town hall in the city. At
this latter meeting the attendance has been from
forty to fifty people and a deep interest is shown
in the Revelation.

SEATTLE.
The Cause in Seattle is firm and steadfast. Week-
ly meetings are held every Sunday afternoon at the
residence of Mr. and Mrs. John A. Finch, and upon
the occasion of coming visitors, who speak to us,
they are held at various places in the city.
During the past month We have listened to able
talks by Mr. Thornton Chase, who was with us for
several days. His talks were strong and eloquent
and reached the ears of interested listeners.
