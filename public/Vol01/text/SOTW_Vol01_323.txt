THE MASHRAK-EL-AZKAR IN ALLIERICA.

TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
Through Zia Effendi, the sun of Mostafa Efiendi Bag-
dadi, to the maid-servant of God, Mlrs. Corinne
True, Chicago, Ill.
Upon her be 
HE IS 
thou attracted maid-servant of God!
Verily I read thy letter which indicated thy stead-
fastness in the Covenant of God and evinced thy
Walking in the Straight Path toward the Kingdom of
God.
Verily I entered in the country of Egypt, trusting
in God, attracted to His Kingdom and enkindled
with the Fire of His Love, hoping to arise in the
Servitude of the Threshold of Baha, and I am al-
ways, day and night, serving. There is no rest,
tranquility or composure.
I beg of God to encircle ye with the Most Great
Bounty and confirm ye with the Most Eminent Grace
which consists of building the Mashrak-el-Azkar of
America in Chicago! This foundation will have the
greatest effect in the hearts of the people of faith-
fulness. Therefore, endeavor ye with all your pow-
er and generosity so that ye' may raise this first
foundation in the Name of Baha on the continent of
America.
I supplicate God to pour upon thee heavenly bless-
ings and that thy family be protected from every
sadness and sorrow in this world.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
