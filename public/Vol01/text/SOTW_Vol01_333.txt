RECENT TABLETS FROM ABDULBAHA.
Through Mr. MacNutt and Mirza Ahmad to Madame
Aurelia Bethlen.
HE IS eon!
thou seeker of Truth!
The letter which thou hast Written through Mr.
MacNutt Was received. As he is a beloved channel, I
Will immediately answer your letter, although I have
little time.
You have expressed your longing for my presence
in that country. Although I, too, have infinite long-
ing to meet the believers on that continent, yet that
region must attain to the capacity of attracting the
presence of Abdul-Baha. A harmonious and Wonder-
ful banquet must be prepared, at which every kind
of heavenly food may be served: after Which you may"
send me an invitation.
That heavenly food consists of deeds which are in
accord With the Di-vine Teachings. The first food is
the Love of God. The second food is the attraction
to the breaths of the Holy Spirit. The third food is
union and harmony among all the believers. The
fourth food is sincerity, trustworthiness, kindness,
purity of intention and service to all humankind.
Should ye prepare and serve such a delicious, sweet
and tempting banquet unquestionably Abdul-Baha
will hasten to America to partake of that food.
Therefore endeavor ye with all your might that this
Food be prepared.
Upon ye be Baha-el-ABHA!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
