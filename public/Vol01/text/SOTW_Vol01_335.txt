BAHAI NEWS 3
To Dr. Ameen U. Fareed.
Upon him be 
HE IS eon!
thou who art unique!
Thy letter dated January 19, 1911, Was received.
You have Written of the good news from California
and from Chicago. I hope that the news from these
places may become better and that the glad-tidings
may come of the Word of God becoming efi'ective in
all parts of the American continent; nay, rather,
that it may move the Whole of the Western hemi-
sphere.
If the beloved of God should unite and should
agree as it is requisite, thou canst rest assured that
in the shortest space of time the Sun of the Heav-
ens (spiritual heavens) Will so shine from the King-
dom of ABHA as to rend asunder all the veils of
superstitions.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!
(Sigvwd) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

Through Shahnaz Khanum.
Upon her be 
HE IS 
my God! my God! Thou seest these chil-
dren, branches of the Tree of Life, birds of the
Garden of Safety, pearls of the shells of the ocean of
Thy Mercy and roses of the rose-garden of Thy
Guidance. 
Lord! Verily We glorify in Thy praise, sanctity
Thee and supplicate to the Kingdom of Thy Merci-
fulness to make us candles of guidance, stars of the
horizon of the Eternal Majesty among the creatures;
and teach us from Thy Knowledge, Glory of the
Most Glorious!

In a recent Tablet from Abdul-Baha to Dr. Fareed, the fol-
lo_wing appears:_ "God willing, through the endeavor of the
friends 1n America, may the Bird of Paradise be revealed in
all its beauty in the Philippine Islands." This refers to a
command received some time ago that the Cause would be
served exceedingly if one or two of the friends would journey
to the Philippines and convey the Message there.
