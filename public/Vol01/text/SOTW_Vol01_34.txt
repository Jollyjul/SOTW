14 BAHAI 
The unity developed by our teachings is strik-
ingly exemplified by the presence frequently at our
meetings of brothers from India, Japan, the Philip-
pines and China, beside our dear Persian brothers.
The shades of belief among the local members is as
varied and divergent, before the transformation of
the Word making us one.
The Feast of Naurooz, March 21, was given by
the children of our Sunday School, and was well
attended. Those present pronounced the exercises
most effective. Our dear little sister, Ruth Fuhr-
man, eleven years old, presided with dignity. The
narrative of Professor Browne's meeting with
and Abdul-Baha was read feelingly
by Mary Hotchkiss, while Helen Hotchkiss ably
gave the history and summarized the teachings of
the Revelation. Bessie Ripley read some of the
Words, as did also Beula Barnitz. These, with
Minnie Barnitz and Paul Hannen, chanted prayers
in Arabic. Esther Hughes gave two violin solos,
displaying marked ability.
Mr. George S. Hopper and daughter, formerly of
Ithaca, N. Y., are welcome additions to our local
Assembly. Miss Hebe Moore; who will travel with
Madame acks-on, left here two weeks ago and will
be greatly missed.
Two marriages have changed our list of member-
ship, though only in name, as the friends remain
with us. Mrs. Josephine Conklin Cowles became
Madame DeLagnel, and Miss Ursula Shuman is
now Mrs. Elwyn Moore, the transformations occur-
ring during the same week. Our congratulations
and love are with the happy families thus united.
The BAHAI is a welcome visitor, being
enthusiastically received, and its success seems
assured. If the friends everywhere will add finan-
cial support to appreciation, an edifice of perma-
nence and utility will be builded.

NEWS NOTES.
Dr. Fisher, of New York City, is now in London,
England.
When Mrs. Brittingham was in Acca, Abdul-Baha
desired her to tell all pilgrims not to visit Acca
during the summer season on account of its un-
healthfulness.
