HE IS eon!
Praise be unto Thee, my God! Thanks be
unto Thee my Beloved! Glory be unto Thee,
my Lord! for that which Thou hast bestowed,
favored, conferred and granted. For Thou hast
chosen sincere servants from among Thy people to
serve Thy Religion. Thou hast elected them to
draw inspiration from Thy Manifest Light, attrac-
tion from Thy Luminous Beauty and to walk in
Thy straight path. my Lord! Verily the souls
are heedless of Thy mentioning and hearts de-
prived of Thy love, the eyes veiled from beholding
the Kingdom of Thy Beauty and the intellects
wandering away from the Centre of Thy Glory,
except those who are firm in Thy Covenant, free
from dissension, attracting the rays of the Sun
of Truth, detaching themselves from inharmony,
arising in the service of Thy Cause amongst Thy
people and exhilarated from the pure wine of Thy
Kingdom. Bestow upon them unlimited blessing
and creative good from the never-ending Bounty,
and pour upon them with great abundance, from
the Cloud of Thy Majesty, the rain of Thy Grace,
the water of Thy Generosity and the Universal
Favor.
Lord, suffer them to become the signs of Thy
Guidance, the standards of the Realm of Might,
the words of virtue, the army of the Supreme Con-
course and the angels of heaven, so that through
them the East and the West of the earth may be~
come illumined, Thy Name be mentioned in the
North and South, that they may educate all races
and communities and clothe them with the garment
of the comely names and the perfect example in
this realm of existence.
