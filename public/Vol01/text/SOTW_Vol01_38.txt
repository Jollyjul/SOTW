4 BAHAI NEWS
faithful servant. Crown my head with this re-
fulgent diadem, cause my blood to be shed in Thy
Cause, my body to be suspended between heaven
and earth, this temple to be dismembered and its
bones be disjoined by the arrows of the enemies.
0- ye friends of Abdul-Baha! In these days,
through the happy circumstances and the confirma-
tion of the Lord of the Supreme Heavens and the
assistance of the Unseen Kingdom, the holy re-
mains of His highness the Supreme (Bab) were
transferred to the Mount of Carmel in Haifa in
the present Tomb. Therefore, it is necessary for
the believers to celebrate the occasion with joy and
happiness. The believers in Tabriz became exhila-
rated with this cup and with the polo of mag-
nanimity carried away the ball of service from the
arena of the Cause. Perhaps later on the people of
hatred and enmity, may calumniate and misrepre-
sent the facts, stating that the blessed remains of
the Bab are in some other place, or that a part of
it is elsewhere. The friends of God must know that
this is a pure falsehood, calumny and malicious
slander. That blessed, crucified body is interred
in its entirety on Mount Carmel, but the enemies
will not rest quiet. It is certain that they will
raise a clamor and claim that we stole that blessed
body, or fraudulently transferred it or got hold of
a part of it, or that the genii took it away from
the firm ones. All these statements are fabrica-
tions and slanders. The whole truth is explained
here.
Upon ye be 
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA

ton, D-. C., March 3, 1910.)
