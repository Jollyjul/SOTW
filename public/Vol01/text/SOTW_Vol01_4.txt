dom from the Blessed Perfection so that at the cost
of the shedding of his blood the door of meeting
might become open to the servants of God and the
maid-servants of the Merciful. This supplication
was accepted and the Purest Branch sacrificed his
life, as it is known in history, the result of which
was the opening of the gates of Acca to the believ-
ers.

THE UNITY BAND.
The purpose of "The Unity Band" is to correspond
with the \Vomen's Assemblies of the Orient. Each
member follows in rotation with a letter
to one of the Assemblies. As there are twelve As-
semblies and twelve members of the Unity Band,
each Assembly is insured a letter. The
results of the last year's work have been most grati-
fying to Abdul-Baha; and in a letter received by
one of the members from Mirza Aziolah Khan, of
Teheran (to whom all letters are addressed), he
assures her of the great joy and happiness these
letters bring to the-se dear sisters of the East, and
earnestly begs their continuance.
The revised list of our Unity Band, to begin March,
1910, is as follows:
Isabella D. Brittingham.
Pauline Barton-Peeke.
Ida A. Finch.
Henrietta O. \/Vagner.
Marie L. Botay.
Harriet Latimer.
Louise R. Waite.
Elizabeth H. Stewart.
May B. Maxwell.
M. Leslie O'Keefe.
Claudia Stuart Ooles.
Emma V. Goodale.
