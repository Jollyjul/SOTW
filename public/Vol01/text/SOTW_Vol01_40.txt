fered for the Cause of God during fifty years! Be-
fore his conversion, too, he was a very important
Mullah and he sacrificed position, Wealth, name,
everything for the sake of It was a
great privilege to have met and known such a

LETTER FROM MR. STRUVEN.
S. S. Bangala, Feb. 28, 1910.
Dear brother Dr. Bollesz Just a few lines to
acknowledge your beautiful spiritual letter. Indeed
you are right; it will take a lot more sufiering in
this world to open people's eyes and show them the
pure self-sacrificing way to serve humanity. It
will come, believe me, and it will not be so very
long.
We are sailing for Calcutta after a stay of one
month in Burmah. We spent five heavenly days
with our devoted brothers in Mandalay, and these
people who, a few years ago, would have killed us
if we had touched them, now loved us and could
not serve us enough in any way. We also spent
three days ofi in a jungle village of Deadnan,
where the Cause has only been planted for three
years and there are now more than four hundred
Bahais here. Seventy-five accepted the Cause
in the three days we were there. In Rangoon,
where we spent most of our time, we had three
large meetings which were advertised, every eve-
ning We W-ould hold minor meetings and all day
people would come and go and We would give them
the teachings. I find the Cause growing every-
where, not making converts by thousands, but just
quietly working, and I would rather see this than
to have thousands flow in and then fall by the
wayside. When a cause goes quietly but surely, it
is worth noticing.
Mr. Remey joins me in sending Bahai love and
greetings to all the dear friends in Denver.
Sincerely your humble brother in God's Cause,
Howard O. Struven.
