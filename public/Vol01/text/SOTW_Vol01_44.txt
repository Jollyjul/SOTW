The BAHAI makes no apology for devoting
much space to the messages of greeting from the
Honolulu Assembly. In the providence of God,
Hawaii is undoubtedly the hub of the "islands of
the sea," especially that of the Pacific--the ocean
of peace. In the description of the Feast of Nau-
rooz, the service in the Oahu prison and in the
verse "Aloha," We feel the glow, the fragrance, the
soothing breath oi love, and a something sweeps
overt the the melody of which can
never be forgotten. On behalf of all we return
their greeting: "Aloha!"
