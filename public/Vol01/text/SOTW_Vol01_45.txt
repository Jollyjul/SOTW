BAHAI NEWS 11

Let Hawaii share the message which the world
sends forth today,
A message which grows fuller as the years shall
pass away,
Let Hawaii's sons and daughters stand ready, heart
and hand,
To make His burden lighter, throughout this
blessed land,
Aloha, word of parting or word of greeting, too,
Aloha, Abdul-Baha, our love to Thee anew.

NAUROOZ IN HAWAII.
With skies cleared by night showers, March 21st,
Naurooz dawned a glorious spring day--a happy
New Year indeed. It seemed as though the whole
universe must lovingly acknowledge and praise the
Supreme Creator of such a perfect day.
*"Aloha" is the Hawaiian word of greeting and means "love."
