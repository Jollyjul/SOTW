12 BAHAI NEWS
The hour of nine-fifteen found several Bahai
friends assembled ready for the twelve-mile rail-
road journey to the Pearl Harbor peninsula, we
numbered the Bahai number nine. Through rice
fields and duck ponds, on through the cane fields,
now by the water's edge and again riding inland,
always in view of the beautifully tinted hills and
valleys, stopping here and there to let passengers
on and off, the train sped on to Pearl City. Here,
our hostess met us, the light of gladness illumin-
ing her face. Taking the peninsula train, we
rode on through more rice fields and soon arrived
at the home blessed indeed by such a peaceful
gathering.
The house was prettily decorated with greens and
flowers and seemed to open its arms to welcome
each of us on entering. The ladies soon made
themselves at home, in assisting with the arrange-
ments for the feast, or with a bit of needlework
and listening to the reading of Mrs. Waite's beauti-
ful letters.
When a. later train brought four more ladies we
walked over to the water's edge where the sea
breeze refreshed us during the long hour to 'dinner.
From the steps of a cottage there, a bench and
the grassy lawn, we again listened to the letters
and later discussed plans for the Easter Sunday
service at the Oahu prison, as well as plans for
raising funds toward the building of the Mashrak-
el-Azkar, in Chicago.
A neighbor on the peninsula, joined us and six-
teen sat down to the delicious feast prepared.
After repeating "Allaho'Abha" nine times, the
"Hidden Words" were read around the long table,
then came the reading of the beautiful Tablet of
the Feast and the Spirit was most certainly with
us.
Train time came all too quickly and we bade
farewell to our kind hostess and started back to
town, reaching Honolulu at five-thirty, where we
scattered for our different homes.
