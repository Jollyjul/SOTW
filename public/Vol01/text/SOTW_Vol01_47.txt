14 BAHAI NEWS
Although -our brother did not give the Message,
his words were very helpful and a word in regard
to The Most Great Prison in which distress and
misfortune has been changed to health, harmony
and blessed service, leads to a longer address at
some future date.
HONOLULU.
The Honolulu Bahai Assembly continues to have
the spiritual meetings every Tuesday afternoon and
every Thursday morning a class for study meets.
In order to better -organize for work, a business
meeting is held twice a month on Friday after-
noons.
One of the sisters has asked the privilege of hav-
ing the "Nineteen-Day Feasts" at her home and in
the evening, so our Bahai men may also be with us
at that time.
Since the visit of our brothers, Mr. Remey and
Mr. Struven, to us November 23rd to December
12th, We have felt a great stimulus and inspira-
tion to work. Many have undoubtedly heard of the
joyous visit and the great interest shown in the
Cause in our midst. During the three weeks of
their visit many meetings were held and they
were invited to speak in homes of those who are
not Bahais.
The harvest seemed truly, ripe and Mr. Remey
said he found more response to the Message here
than in any other place he had visited. This made
us very happy, for the Islands seem destined to be
a place where the Oriental, Occidental and Poly-
nesian races meet and are mingled together.
In February Mr. Sigurd Russell joined the ranks
of the Honolulu Bahais. We gave him a warm
welcome for up to this time our Assembly had
only one man in its ranks. One of our sisters had
known Mr. Russell in the Paris Assembly nine
years before, so he came not as a stranger to all.
He seemed especially sent to us, as none of our
Assembly have visited Acca and Mr. Russell has
made the pilgrimage four times. It isa great joy
and blessing to have among us one who can tell
of the life lived at Acca.
Greetings in His Name,
The Honolulu Assembly.
