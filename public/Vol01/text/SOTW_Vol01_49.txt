BAHAI NEVVS l5
THE MASHRAK-EL--AZKAR.
Through Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, to the maid-servant
of God who is firm in the Covenant, Mrs. Corinne
True (Upon her be Chicago, Ill.:
HE Is eon!
thou daughter of the Kingdom!
Thy letter, dated January 6, 1910, was received
with the enclosed papers.
Regarding the appointment of the time for the
opening of the general convention in Chicago, this
matter is already written about. Undoubtedly you
have received it by this time. It was suggested to
postpone the 20th of March to the days of Rizwan,
in which the climate is temperate.
You have written regarding the election of dele-
gates from among the Oriental Bahais. The season
for this work has not yet come. God willing, in
its opportune time they will be sent.
Several plans and designs of the Mashrak-el-
Azkar have been received from America. Now the
believers must display an endeavor so that the
land may be bought in its entirety; then collect
contributions for the building, and then they may
think about the plans. So far the means are lack-
ing. I hope from the favor of the True One that
sufiicient and ample contribution may be gathered
and afterward the best and most acceptable plans
be decided upon.
Upon thee be Baha-el-ABHA,
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.

1910, Washington, D. C.)
The scripture prophecies are that this Gospel of
the Kingdom will be carried even to the "isles of
the sea," and a proof that such prophecies are now
being fulfilled, came in a letter from Mr. Jenner,
of London, containing a contribution from theisle
of Mauritius, in the Indian ocean and east of the
island of Madagascar, off the coast of Africa.
Two little sisters aged three and five, from Mus-
kegon, Mich., have taken exceeding joy in sending
the contents of their blessing box to the conven-
tion.
