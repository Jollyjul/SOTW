BAHAI NEVVS 5
TABLET BY 
A tablet by to the Persian Zoro-
astrian Bahais. Revealed in the purest old Per-
sian language, Without an Arabic word in it.*
1N THE NAME or Gon THE 
Glory is due unto God, the Discoverer, Who,
through one shower of the ocean of His Gen-
erosity, expanded the firmament of existence, be-
gemmed it with the stars of knowledge and sum-
moned the people to the most high court of per-
ception and understanding!
This shower, which is the Primal Word of the
Almighty, is sometimes called the VVater of Life,
for it quickens the dead souls in the desert of
ignorance with the spring of intelligence. Some-
times it is called the First Emanation which ap-
pears from the Sun of 'Wisdom, and When it began
to shine the first movement became manifest and
known; then phenomena stepped into the arena of
existence and these appearances were through the
generosity of the Incomparable, the Wise One. He
is the Knower, the Giver! He is sanctified and
holy above every statement and attribute! The
seen and the unseen fail to attain the measure of
His understanding. The World of being and What-
ever has issued from it bears Witness to this
utterance.
Therefore, it has become known that the First
Bestowal of the Almighty is the Word. The re-
ceiver and acceptor of it is the understanding. It
is the First Instructor in the University of Exist-
ence and it is the Primal Emanation of God.
Whatever has appeared is through the reflection
of its Light and Whatever is manifested is the
appearance of its Wisdom. All the names origi-
nate in His Name and the beginnings and endings
of all aifairs are in His Hand.
