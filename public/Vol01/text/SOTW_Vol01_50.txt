16 BAHAI NEWS
The Vaheed Choral Society of Chicago is pleased
with the results of its concert given recently for
the Mashrak-el-Azkar. About $65.00 was realized
through the efforts of the Society.
Again the noble Persian believers have rallied
to our aid, sending through a Washington friend,
returning from Abdul-Baha, ?66 or $330.00. To
give from the overflow of one's cup is easy, but to
give from its very contents and go without is true
sacrifice. To read Dr. Moody's letters will prove to
us the noble self-denial our Persian friends must
make to aid us.
Abdul-Baha's parting words to Mr. Woodcock
last summer were, "Be patient, it is all coming as
I want it."

The Sunday morning meetings at 11 o'clock,
held in Beckton Hall, 200 Huntington Ave., con-
tinue to grow in numbers and in the power of the
Spirit.
Miss Hebe Moore, of the Washington, D. C., As-
sembly, was present at the meeting on April 17th.
The visits of brothers and sisters from other As-
semblies do much toward strengthening us and en-
larging our consciousness of the meaning of this
great "family of God."
We are now anticipating a visit from Mr. Percy
F. Woodcock, of New York, after the Convention.
Mrs. Alice Ives Breed's recent visit to New York
has brought us close to the earnestness and faith
of that Assembly.
Mrs. Sprague is spending a few weeks in New
York.
Mr. Harlan F. Ober was unanimously elected as
our representative to the Chicago Temple Unity
Convention.
When we realize the truth of our prayer: "All
are His servants and all are standing by His Com-
mand," it is beyond our capacity to estimate the
vitalizing efiect -of such a meeting. God's bounties
are manifold in the Cause, and to Him be the
glory.
