BAHAI NEWS 19
Mr. Woodcock h-ad intended to return home on
Monday morning, he agreed to remain over a day
in order to visit the Baltimore Assembly at their
Tuesday night meeting. So on 24 hours notice a
meeting was called for Monday night, at Mrs.
Barnitz's home. Again a large audience assembled.
The Unity Feast of April 9, previously mentioned
as notable because it was the first where the white
and the colored Bahais united, was held and
proved to be Wonderfully blessed and successful.
Several leading men and women of the colored
race attended. Mr. Gregory gave the Message most
eloquently. Mrs. George William Cook expressed
in a few Well=chosen words her approbation of the
Cause. Several of the friends read Tablets and
the children again chanted melodiously in Arabic.
Miss Knobloch was the hostess of the evening.
Our thanks are due to Mr. H. S. Cragin and Miss
Stamper for the use of their home, which is the
great double parlor Where the Assembly was so
happy for a few months prior to the securing of
our present location.
Dr. Fareed is still with us; Miss Engelhorn has
departed, going to Chicago, where she will be a
delegate at the Convention.
Mr. Remey has been heard from, this time in
Baroda and Bombay, with Mr. Struven. He re-
ports that at Baroda a meeting was planned under
the auspices of the government, to which the secre-
tary of state issued invitations to the ofiicials.
