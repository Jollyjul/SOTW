SOME ANSWERED QUESTIONS
By LAURA CLIFFORD BARNEY
Cloth $1.25; postage 15c. extra
This book contains most valuable information on a
variety of subjects. It was dictated by Abdul-Baha
during his spare moments to Miss Barney during her two
years' stay in Acca, and by her translated from the
Persian into English. It follows well upon the opening
made by the above book by M. Dreyfus. It is in the easy
style of the great master, food alike for the learned and
for the simple hearted. The book is printed also in
French and Persian.

By THORNTON CHASE
Paper Covered 500.; postage 10?.
This book contains a most excellent compilation of
the teachings of Baha'0'llah, gathered from various
translations and arranged so as to be harmonious and
and consecutive as to subjects. Aside from this Mr.
Chase's argument is convincing, you soon get into the
swing of it and are carried right along, and it leaves
with you a pleasant realization of the sweetness and
strength of the Bahai Revelation.
