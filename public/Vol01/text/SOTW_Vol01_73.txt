Audit Committee.
On motion of Miss Boylan, the following reso-
lution was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the Executive Board beinstruct-
ed to address itself to the problem of acquiring
the tract of land between Sheridan Road and Lake
Michigan, and be empowered to take such action
to that end as in their judgment may be wise
and discreet and consonant with the directions of
Abdul-Baha.
To this motion it was amended by Mr. Hoar
that the Executive Board be instructed to follow
the principle of consultation with Friends guided
to assist in this work of negotiation and consoli-
dation.
Mr. Honore Jaxon presented a full report of
negotiations had and pending for the change of
Sheridan Road and the vacation of certain streets
and alleys in the Temple site. This he illustrated
by plats and surveys showing the exact situation
and boundaries of the site, its exact dimensions
and center, together with the direction line from
its center to Acca. His report showed most
courteous and just treatment from the several
public ofiicials with whom the negotiations had
been conducted. Many apparent difliculties had
been removed by happy coincidences and a spirit
of sweet reasonableness guiding and controlling
confirmations of divine favor.
He also reported the steps taken to insure
perfect title to Bahai Temple Unity of the por-
tions of the site embraced within all such vacated
streets and alleys, also proposed construction of
sidewalks.
