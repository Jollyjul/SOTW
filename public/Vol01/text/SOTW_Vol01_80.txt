26 BAHAI NEVVS
divine promises which have been uttered for the
comfort and encouragement of all those who in
any way shall find themselves privileged to bear
a helping hand in this glorious spiritual exercise.
As the matter is now agreed upon, by all the
parties in interest, our holdings are so consoli-
dated that on our own land we can draw a circle
of nearly five hundred feet diameter, while for
purposes of lawn and garden an additional terri-
perhaps a 20% increase-has
been freely placed at our disposal, to be so beauti-
fied as we please.
LETTER FROM RANGOON, INDIA.
April 4, 1910.
Dear and honored friends of God in the holy
vineyard of El-Baha:
Your kind note, with the prayers appended
thereto, has wafted in this province the sweet
fragrance of the splendid rose-garden of the West,
and we in the Orient have been watching with
deep admiration the most appreciable movements
of the blessed ones of God in the Occident, as
each and every one of such movements promises
very eloquently to deepen our mutual affection
and most precious blessings in the
Kingdom of Baha. We have fully appreciated the
idea that all the children of ABHA in one voice,
from every region may simultaneously sing the
praise of God and supplicate for help and strength-
to bring into completion the Holy Temple of
Mashrak-el-Azkar, and accordingly made use of the,
prayer as was directed during the Bahai fasting
month, in this Assembly and all other sister As-
semblies of this country. We are very deeply in-
terested in the construction of this noble and
divine institution and it would be our great joy to
hear of its progress every now and then. The
Cause is making very rapid progress. 
In conclusion, I take this opportunity of con-
veying the Bahai love and greetings of the
believers of this place to the beloved ones of
God in the West. I am your devoted brother at
the faithful service of Abdul-Baha.
(Signed) A. ISMAEL.
