28 BAHAI NEWS
CONVENTION ECHOES
BOSTON.
In response to the kind invitation of Mr. and
Mrs. George Ostburg, a number of the believers
were present at a delightful supper given at their
home in South Boston on May 7th, the occasion
of the supper being to welcome our delegate, Mr.
Harlan F. Ober, and to hear his report of the
Chicago Convention. The generous and hospit-

fitting atmosphere in which to learn of the loving
hospitality extended by the members of the
Chicago Assembly to all delegates.
During Mr. Ober's talk that evening, and upon
the Sunday morning following, all present were
made conscious, by what he brought with him, that
he had in truth been on holy ground.
The Power of God has been so manifestly at
work as the "One Remover of difliculties" since
the last Convention that we may expect--if all
are faithful and full of faith--that the seemingly
impossible shall be realized before the next Con-
vention. The financial assistance so generously
sent from the Orient and Mrs. Waite's stirring
"Temple Song" should surely fire each one of us
with a fresh determination to add our shoulder to
the wheel with renewed faith, courage and deter-
mination and make it possible for the Bahai
Temple Unity to begin building operations without
loss of time. "The field is white unto harvest"
and there is need for as speedy action as possible.
In unity and in faith lie our power. God's blessing
is upon each earnest endeavor.

this meeting with the friends that when he
returned, all received a portion of the divine
bounty.
The reality of those days of meeting and gather-
