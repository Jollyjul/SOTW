ing in Chicago is the true foundation of the
Temple, and the radiance of divine love and unity
shed upon that conclave of the faithful has surely
been difiused far and wide to the ends of the
earth.
Our revered Abdul-Baha said to some Montreal
believers who were in Acca last year, that we
were gathered together through no aim,
neither for political motives, nor social interest,
nor any purpose, but by the Power of the
Word of God, in the utmost love, unity and attrac-
tion. With a look of great serenity and peace, he
said: "This is a meeting of pure love; nothing
mars our perfect unity; therefore, the influence
and power of this gathering will be felt through-
out the world and its efiects will last forever and
ever."
We are happy and thankful in partaking of the
blessings of this great Day of God, and we send
love and greetings to the dear ones everywhere
through the BAHAI Nnws.

At our regular meeting at Genealogical Hall,
226 West 58th Street, Sunday morning, May 8th,
we listened to a report from our delegates who
attended the Temple Convention in Chicago.
Our own delegates, Mr. Mountfort Mills and
Miss Boylan, spoke and we also had the pleasure
of having rwith us Mrs. Lincoln who was the
Brooklyn delegate and who also spoke to us.
They all gave us the most beautiful accounts of
the great love and harmony which was every-
where in evidence at the Convention. We all felt
as if we had been personally present and expressed
the wish that we might be there next year, as
our hearts and spirits were this year.

On the Thursday evening next following the
close of the Convention the delegates and Chicago
Bahais celebrated the 19-day Feast at the "den"
of brothers axon and Sprague at 1751 West Lake
St. Seats and friends were just evenly balanced,
and a delightful Spiritual Feast kept pace with the
cakes and tea.
