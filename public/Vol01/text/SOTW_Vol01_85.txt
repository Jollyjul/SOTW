HE IS 
0 ye Spiritual Friends of 
How long are ye silent and speechless!
Although ye are speaking, yet in this age the
speech of the believers of God must be the soul
entrancing melody of the Kingdom of ABHA and
the harmony of the Supreme Concourse!
Therefore Abdul-Baha is not satisfied with a
meek voice and depressing lamentation! He
seeks the passionate tumult and joyous clamor
and he roars and cries at the top of his voice so
that the realities of things may stir into move-
ment and action and the Beloved of Bounty
unveil her Countence in the world of creation!
Those friends must, like unto the stars in
heaven, shine and gleam in the horizon of
Truth with the Light of Guidance so that the
realities of the existent beings and the spirit of
humankind may find joy and happiness!
Upon ye be greeting and praise!
(Signed) ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
