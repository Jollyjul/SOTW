BAHAI NEVVS 9'
of the Peerless, Wise One, the Sun of Knowledge
has appeared from behind the covering of the Spirit
and all the birds of the meadow of oneness are
intoxicated with the Wine of Understanding and are
commemorating the ame of the Beloved. Happy
is the one who finds this and becomes immortal.
(Translated by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, Chicago,
Sept. 8, 1909.)

In a letter from the Bahai Assembly at Mashad,
Persia, dated October 18, 1909, is the following:
"The latest news which has happened in these parts,
is that two villages in the Province of Khorassan,
called Hassar and Namag, five sanctified souls were
martyred, and four of our spiritual sisters Were as-
saulted and Wounded, and they have cut off the ears
of one the believers; while other ,Bahais have been
the subjects of persecution, pillage, etc."
