12 BAHAI NEWS
BOSTON.
On May 15th about forty people were gathered,
in Beckton Hall to hear Mr. Percy Woodcock,
of New York City. So truly did Mr. Woodcock
bring to us the Spirit of Acca that it was diflicult
to realize we were so many thousand miles apart.
The Message was so simply and clearly given that
even strangers were touched by it.
It is ever a blessing to come in contact with
those who have sojourned in that Holy House-
hold and the Boston Assembly is grateful for hav-
ing had this opportunity.
In the afternoon a few of the believers met at
the home of Mr. A.usten in Jamaica Plain, and in
the evening Mr. Woodcock shared again with
others in Allston his experiences of Acca.
Humility and reverence are two distinct char-
acteristics brought by all who have been in the
presence of Abdul-Baha. Those two greatly needed
elements in our American life, coupled with the
fire of enthusiasm they all have, make a strong
setting for the love which they bring from Him
whose life is all Love and Service.
